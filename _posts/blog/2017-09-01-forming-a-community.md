Last Tuesday, we witnessed how the [**Progressive Hacknight**](http://www.progressivehacknight.org) is becoming an amazing space of collaboration and creation. Techies and organizers from different progressive spaces collaborated on projects focused on gender equality, single-payer healthcare, universal basic income, voter empowerment, and more — all these were being built in our humble space! We are so honored and excited to be working alongside you towards a better New York. Among the breakout groups:

*   **Nancy, Traci, and Emily** of [NYPAN](http://proghacknight.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=597c1a32f8812c62dfc1126f5&id=cf253ed8ea&e=d6e565a1ee) are looking for help to **reach out to 3 million non-party-affiliated voters** to educate them on the importance of participating in the primaries.
