We live in precarious times. The current administration has undermined the lives of 800,000 undocumented immigrants by announcing that they are rolling back the **[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals)** (DACA), a program started during the Obama administration that has been protecting 800,000 young Americans who arrived in the country as a child from deportation.

Progressive HackNight stands with you and reminds you that we are not alone in this. Rather, we shall and we will move forward together. The community is in solidarity with DACA recipients and immigrant families, who are part of this magnificent fabric of our beautiful city and this country.

With that, we are looking forward to seeing you at **[our next hacknight on September 12](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/progressive-hacknight-at-thoughtworks-tickets-35597117938)**. We will have the **leaders of Indivisible groups in New York** speak about their current efforts in New York, specifically anti-hate initiatives, and tactics for defending immigrants.

[**RSVP to the Sept 12 HackNight**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/progressive-hacknight-at-thoughtworks-tickets-35597117938 "RSVP to the Sept 12 HackNight")

[Indivisible](http://www.indivisible.org)’s national Senior Data Adviser **Josh Nussbaum**, **Nicole Powell** of [NY Indivisible](https://www.facebook.com/NYIndivisible/), **Ginger Albertson** of [Indivisible Brooklyn](http://indivisiblebrooklyn.com/), and **Lisa Raymond-Tolan** of [Indivisible Nation BK](https://www.facebook.com/oneindivisiblenation/) will all speak at the September 12 hacknight.  
Indivisible has recently done work to defend Healthcare, resisting the regressive policies of this administration that will rollback healthcare benefits to millions of Americans. Now, Indivisible chapters across the United States are working to [resist this administration’s efforts to rollback DACA](http://standup.indivisibleguide.com).
We will hear their stories, how they got where they are now, and how we as technologists can amplify and support their efforts.
