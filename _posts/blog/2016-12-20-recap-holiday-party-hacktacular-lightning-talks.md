    <em>The Prog Hacknight Holiday Party Hacktacular - Lightning Talks</em>
</small>
</p>

On December 13th 2016, Prog Hacknight hosted our last event of the year: [The Prog Hacknight Holiday Party Hacktacular](https://chihacknight.org/events/2016/12/13/holiday-party-hack-tacular.html).

Based on the success of our[ two](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/04/15/tales-from-200.html)[ previous](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/07/21/lightning-talks-part-deux.html) Lightning Talk rounds, we decided to end 2016 with a another round of talks from members of our community.

Eight members of the Prog Hacknight community shared their own story or insight about civics, society and technology.

The major themes this time around were the needs, tactics and benefits of inclusion, perspective on our community’s role in society, and the responsibilities that we have as users of data.

You can watch all of the talks below, or all together in [one big YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_dBjjdnIbKwRqHl8yBReTqtnL78P802N). Thanks again to everyone who presented!

<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NwS27OcpMRY" width="100%"></iframe></p>



Recently, Don Chartier has been researching data privacy and the risks of re-identification, and ran across an article, "[BROKEN PROMISES OF PRIVACY: RESPONDING TO THE SURPRISING FAILURE OF ANONYMIZATION](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1450006)".

Don summarizes that typical anonymization techniques, like removing personally identifiable information (PII), are no longer sufficient, but privacy laws give firms that just remove PII "safe harbor" (i.e., they're off the hook).

### 3. Viktor Köves: Documentation & Inclusion

<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HnRRyKktyV4" width="100%"></iframe></p>



Making a project accessible is about more than just the culture of the initial team behind it. Good documentation paves the way for a project to get external contributors interested, keep them involved, and allow non-technical folks to join in.

Viktor Köves gives some examples of projects that are documented well and shows how they are much more likely to thrive even after original collaborators have shifted focus.

### 4. Yonatan Kogan: Encouraging Gender balance at conferences
