On August 1, Sonya Reynolds, Data Director for the [NY Civic Engagement Table](http://www.cvhaction.org/civic_engagement) and member of the steering committee of [Progressive Hacknight](//progressivehacknight.org), will lead a panel of organizers and technologists whose works are focused on engaging with communities and voters through SMS texting.

August 1 is going to be a doozy. Sonya Reynolds, Data Director of NY Civic Engagement Table, will lead a panel of organizers and technologists who have used SMS to engage, mobilize, and organize communities. This is the first of many lightning talks and we're excited to launch this series with you. Joining the panel are the following awesome people:

• Allie Monck and Joyce Li from the [NYC Council Public Technology](http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/DepartmentDetail.aspx?ID=8866&GUID=72EEA817-E6FF-4051-B853-BC1DAD04E8CC) office

• Fryda Guedes - [Hispanic Federation](http://hispanicfederation.org/)’s Director of Immigration and Civic Engagement

• Josh Cohen – will talk about his work on Hero, a digital platform used by BC NDP which helped them win the elections through volunteer engagement.

We are currently confirming other speakers – will definitely keep you posted! If you have ideas on who should be at the lightning talks, would love to hear your thought at #pitch-zone or email us at [steering@proghacknight.org](mailto:steering@proghacknight.org).

**Food** Food and drinks will be provided. We encourage attendees to bring their own water bottles to reduce waste.
