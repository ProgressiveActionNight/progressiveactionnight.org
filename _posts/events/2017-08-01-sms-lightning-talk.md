On August 1, Sonya Reynolds, Data Director for the [NY Civic Engagement Table](http://www.cvhaction.org/civic_engagement) and member of the steering committee of [Progressive Hacknight](//progressivehacknight.org), will lead a panel of organizers and progressive tech founders whose works are focused on engaging with communities and voters through SMS texting.
