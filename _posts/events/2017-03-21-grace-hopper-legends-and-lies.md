[Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) lived a life of firsts; she was among the first girls in her neighborhood to have electricity in her home, one of the first generation of women in the US to vote in a presidential election, one of the first women ever to receive an advanced degree in mathematics, and one of only a handful of female admirals in the US Navy.

But the first that Grace became famous for was being one of the first computer pioneers. Grace shaped not only an industry but through her contributions to computer completely reshaped the society we live in today.

While it's true that Grace literally wrote the book on how to program the worldâ€™s first computers many of the story about Grace as misleading or patently false.
