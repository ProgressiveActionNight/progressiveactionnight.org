## Oct 10 is Progressive HackNight
Join the community for another night of civic hacking! We will meet on Tuesday for an evening focused on the amazing work of our breakout groups. After pizza, introductions and announcements, we’ll jump straight into our projects. Whether you are already collaborating with a group, or want to volunteer for something new, this is a great chance to use your skills and take meaningful action!

### We’re Seeking Submissions!

If you have a project idea, need help on an existing project, or want to discuss progressive issues with like-minded folks, you can start a breakout group at the HackNight!  Here’s how to do it:

1. Check out the breakout page. This page lists all the active breakout groups in the community and can provide a guide on how to start your own.

2. If you’re ready to enlist your breakout group, head over to GitHub or Google Form and write it up! We have provided a template for you to follow.

3. At the HackNight itself, focus on what you’re trying to achieve. Do you need help assessing requirements? Do you plan on coding? Do you want help on testing? Having a clear plan for the breakout will help bring the right people to your project.

You can always approach any of the steering committee members and tell them about your breakout idea! We’re all about making great ideas happen and we have already helped a number of projects to get started.

Vesha wrote an amazing article about how you can ramp up your projects at the HackNight. After you’ve created your breakout group, be sure to read that too!
