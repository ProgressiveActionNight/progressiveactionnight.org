## Dec 5: 2018 Planning at the Avaaz HQ

We are going to have a planning meeting to map out what’s going to happen on 2018. We see this as an opportunity both to reflect on the past year and to look forward. With a planning framework in the works, we want your input on how we see progressive technology and its place in 2018.
