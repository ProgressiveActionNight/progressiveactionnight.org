# July 17th is Progressive WorkNight x Reboot Democracy
Progressive HackNight is teaming up with [Reboot Democracy](www.rebootdem.com) to create a night full of project pitches and advice, speakers, and community building. We will provide space for our usual breakout groups at the start of the event, and the remainder of the event will be dedicated to projects who want community input on their progress, and lightning talks. You’re welcome to join the standard breakout groups and contribute to them the entire event, or partake in Reboot Democracy’s additional programming. The schedule is below.

**6:00 - 6:30:** Registration / Check-in / Happy Hour

**6:30 - 6:50:** Progressive HackNight <> Reboot Democracy Joint Welcome

**6:50 - 7:10:** PHN Breakout group announcements and work start

**7:15 - 8:00:** Four to six early-stage teams will have 5 minutes each to present what they're working on, get feedback and answer questions from the audience

(10 minute break)

**8:10 - 8:45:** Lightning talks (5 min each) from Reboot Democracy’s panel of seasoned experts (the former digital director for the White House is one of the current confirmed speakers!)

**8:45 - 9:00:** Q&A

**9:00 - 9:10:** Open mic (anyone with skills to offer or an idea they're working on gets 30-60 seconds to pitch)
