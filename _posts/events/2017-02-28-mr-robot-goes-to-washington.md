This week at Progressive Hacknight, we’ll be looking at data from a less rosy perspective: privacy and abusive collection. What are the risks of collecting too much data, and what can we as consumers of technology do to protect ourselves?

[Edelson PC](http://edelson.com/) specializes in [suing technology companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/technology/unpopular-in-silicon-valley.html) that log data about their users without their knowledge or consent. As explained by a federal court, the Edelson lawyers are "pioneers in the electronic privacy class action field, having litigated some of the largest consumer class actions in the country on this issue."

[Ari Scharg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ari-scharg-4a30b47/), Partner at Edelson PC will give an overview of the consumer privacy issues facing the tech world, and talk about how privacy laws affect tech firms and startups. He will also touch on the immediate need for technologists to help lawmakers understand these issues, and how to get involved in the legislative process.

**ASL** This event will have an American Sign Language interpreter.
