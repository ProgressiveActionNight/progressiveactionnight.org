The Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI) is an international network of academics and non-profits addressing potential threats to federal environmental and energy policy, and to the scientific research infrastructure built to investigate, inform, and enforce. Dismantling this infrastructure -- which ranges from databases to satellites to models for climate, air, and water -- could imperil the public's right to know, the United States' standing as a scientific leader, corporate accountability, and environmental protection.

In response, EDGI is building [online tools](https://envirodatagov.org/event-toolkit/), [events](https://envirodatagov.org/events/), and [research networks](https://envirodatagov.org/about/) to proactively archive public environmental data and ensure its continued public availability. We also are monitoring changes to federal regulation, enforcement, research, funding, websites and general agency management at agencies including EPA, DOE, NASA, NOAA, and OSHA. We aim to serve the environmental community and its allies, and to enable them to hold the new administration accountable, by preserving and improving public access to at-risk government environmental data, documents, and digital interfaces, and by [monitoring](https://envirodatagov.org/website-monitoring/), documenting, and analyzing change to [federal environmental agencies](https://envirodatagov.org/agency-forecasts/). We also aim to create an open, collaborative network of individuals, non-profits, universities and companies who believe that science and data are vital for environmental governance.

**Food** Food and drinks will be provided. We encourage attendees to bring their own water bottles to reduce waste.
