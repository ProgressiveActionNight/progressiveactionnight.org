On June 2018, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made history. Her victory in the Democratic primaries last month rocked the political world – and it all happened at the heart of Queens and the Bronx. Hundreds of people who believed in her message of racial, economic, and social dignity for all volunteered in different ways: from canvassing, texting, and phone-banking, to applying their skills in photography, design, and data.

The work of the grassroots heavily contributed to Alexandria's win. At her victory party, Ocasio-Cortez said “this win belongs to each and every one of you”, speaking to the grassroots movement she has started. Who are the grassroots activists that propelled her victory? Where did they start, how were they able to create change, and how can we contribute to actions that affect our community?

We will be joined by Virginia Ramos-Rios, campaign manager of Ocasio 2018; Corey Torpie, campaign photographer; Aaron Taube, DSA Queens Field Coordinator; Ingrid Gomez, volunteer and activist from Corona, Queens; Scott Starrett, Principal at Tandem NYC, the firm behind Alexandria's posters and design assets. They will share their individual stories, the lessons they've learned, and how all of these contributed to the biggest political upset of the year.
