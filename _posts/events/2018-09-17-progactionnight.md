Join us for Progressive Action Night, our series of actions, study groups, and trainings supporting grassroots and progressive campaigns and causes!

This week featuring:

* Phonebanking // Get Organized Brooklyn -- phone banking for Liuba Grechen Shirley

* Secure Text Messaging Training // Rise & Resist -- Signal is an encrypted communications app for Android and iOS. Signal messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted and engineered to keep communication safe. Signal is commonly used by activists for text messages, group chats, and phone calls. At this training, activists will learn what Signal is, how to use it, what it can and cannot do, and get started sending messages. (All participants in the training should bring a smart phone with iOS or Android.)

* Planning // Creative Resistance -- media makers gather to plot supporting campaigns and causes for the midterms

## About the Series
Progressive Action Night, based on Progressive Hack Night (progressivehacknight.org), is meant to systematize, coordinate, and maximize the effectiveness training opportunities and actions for volunteers and organizations looking to mobilize volunteers for the upcoming elections.

## How it works:

- All groups or volunteers are welcome to attend
- Get a concrete training and then get to work, on your issues or someone else's
- Information and education available about other campaigns and groups
- Meet other volunteers and progressives
- Opportunities for organizations to meet and strategize as well
- Easy on-boarding for first-time participants
- Snacks and drinks offered

## Goals
- Offer a clear calendar of opportunities for trainings and on-site actions (textbanks, poster-making, etc.)
- Plug volunteers quickly and efficiently into actions and organizations
- Allow organizers opportunities to meet and strategize

#### **Come if you're curious! There will be onboarding for anyone new**
