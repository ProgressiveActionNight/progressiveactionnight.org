[Human Centered Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design) lives through physically designed objects and out into digital apps that live on our devices. But how do we make sense of it in everyday practice? Can we apply its methodology to validate our own ideas in order to minimize time wasted?

The reality is that there are just too many options out there in the world, and new ideas need to be great ideas in order to rise above the rest. All that is good did not come to be without learning, editing, remaking, and most importantly - understanding people.

[Janice Cho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janice-m-cho-0572b719/), Design Director at [DevMynd Software](https://www.devmynd.com/), will give a talk premised on answering the question: How might we leverage the design methodologies that constitute Human Centered Design to vet our ideas before we build them?

**ASL** This event will have an American Sign Language interpreter.
