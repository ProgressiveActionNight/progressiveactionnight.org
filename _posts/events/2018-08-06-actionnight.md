To help coordinate and facilitate NYC trainings in preparation for the midterm elections and other important struggles, we are organizing a series of biweekly trainings and actions on Monday nights -- under the guise of **Progressive Action Nights**.

The goal of the series, based on Progressive Hack Night, will be to systematize, coordinate, and maximize the effectiveness training opportunities and actions for volunteers and organizations looking to mobilize volunteers for the midterm elections.

During these nights, the space will be available to organizations and volunteers looking to do “afterwork activism” -- volunteers who want to stop by, grab a snack, get trained, learn how to plug in, and do some work.

#### **[Follow us on Meet-Up](//www.meetup.com/Progressive-Action-Nights)**

If you have an organization that is looking for a space to train, or are connected to groups of volunteers, please feel free to contact Duncan (k.duncan.wall (at) gmail (dot) com) or Rapi (rapicastillo (at) gmail (dot) com).

## Goals

* Offer a clear calendar of trainings and on-site actions (textbanks, poster-making, etc.)
* Create a network of trainings and actions for organizations
* Plug volunteers quickly and efficiently into organizations
* Allow organizers opportunities to meet and strategize
