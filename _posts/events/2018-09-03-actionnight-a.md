Join us for our next Progressive Action Night, our biweekly series of actions, study groups, and trainings supporting grassroots and progressive campaigns and causes!  

* Media Training // Rise & Resist -- Learn how to more successfully engage the press for your cause or candidate.

  * Text banking // MoveOn -- On Monday, we will be doing a two hour texting session with the MoveOn Text Team. With the 2018 elections rapidly approaching, the MoveOn texting team has kicked off an ambitious campaign to build progressive power by texting millions of voters in key House districts to "pledge to vote" and to join our MoveOn texting list, with the goal of building our base of volunteers which we can then plug into all of MoveOn’s massive 2018 elections campaigns to ensure we end GOP control of the House and flip key state governments blue!

## About the Series
Progressive Action Night, based on Progressive Hack Night (progressivehacknight.org), is meant to systematize, coordinate, and maximize the effectiveness training opportunities and actions for volunteers and organizations looking to mobilize volunteers for the upcoming elections.

## How it works:

- All groups or volunteers are welcome to attend
- Get a concrete training and then get to work, on your issues or someone else's
- Information and education available about other campaigns and groups
- Meet other volunteers and progressives
- Opportunities for organizations to meet and strategize as well
- Easy on-boarding for first-time participants
- Snacks and drinks offered

## Goals
- Offer a clear calendar of opportunities for trainings and on-site actions (textbanks, poster-making, etc.)
- Plug volunteers quickly and efficiently into actions and organizations
- Allow organizers opportunities to meet and strategize

#### **Come if you're curious! There will be onboarding for anyone new**
