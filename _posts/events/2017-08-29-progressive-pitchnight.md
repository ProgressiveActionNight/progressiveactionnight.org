## Aug 29 is Progressive ~~HackNight~~ PitchNight

Hi! Julian here. I will be the host for the August 29 Progressive HackNight. A lot has happened in the last ten months. I know a lot of attention has been focused on the recent 6 month milestone of the Trump administration in office, but for me, the real shift happened back in November.

Since then we’ve seen so much new activism, so many fantastic ideas, so many urgent calls to action. But when you’re organizing enthusiasm, there’s more energy required to produce results. Recruitment requires awareness, focus craves evangelism and diligence and everything demands effort. An initiative that we’ve been discussing internally is how can we better support projects to achieve their goals.

One way that we can improve the awareness and recruitment phase would be to breathe new life into them. More than the brief introductions afforded workgroups, or the straightforward reportage of a GitHub page. Instead a bone fide pitch delivered with the enthusiasm of it’s greatest advocate - that of the project’s founders.

### Introducing Progressive PitchNight

To that end, we’d like to introduce Progressive PitchNight - a new programming series of Progressive HackNight. On these nights, instead of a speaker, two projects will stand and pitch our community on their purpose, values, opportunities for collaboration and vision for the outcome.

Your pitch will be presented live in the room to those gathered as well as livestreamed on our social platforms. Your pitch deck and the recording of your pitch will be available online on our website for reference by future collaborators. Before and after your pitch, we’ll promote your project on our social media platforms and periodically check in with you on your progress.

### We’re Seeking Submissions!

We’ll be accepting submissions on a rolling basis for inclusion in the next programming slots moving forward. Some consideration will be given to timely projects in reaction to current events, otherwise we will take projects on a first come first serve basis.

At the end of this post, we’ve provided a questionnaire - please fill it out and send it along to us at the #proghacknight channel in the Prog Code slack or in the  #pitch-zone channel on the Progressive HackNight Slack. Or you can email us at steering@progressivehacknight.com (@here do we have a general email addy?)

Once we’ve reviewed your submission, we’ll be picking two projects per PitchNight to present. We’ll respond back to you with a  confirmation of receipt and then follow up with any additional questions as well as when we’ll be able to program your stand up.
