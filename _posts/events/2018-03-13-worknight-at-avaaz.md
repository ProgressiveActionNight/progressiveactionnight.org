This HackNight is a special version of our normal HackNight, and is going to feature new projects focused on fighting the opioid crisis in New York State, developed in partnership with [Civic Hall](https://civichall.org/) and [New York Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/) Eric Schneiderman. We are starting this work by focusing specifically on Take Back Day, a twice-yearly national effort by advocates across the country to help Americans get rid of unused prescription drugs, which are a major source of exposure to opioids leading to addiction. This HackNight will be all about architecture decisions, laying the groundwork for new projects, and taking on leadership roles on the projects that will be deployed for Take Back Day.

The architectural decisions made during this HackNight will be used to further develop a small set of projects from [Pre-HackDay](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hack-for-take-back-day-tickets-43108923952) with the tech leads, PMs, and designers who created the project ideas in the Hack for Take Back Day event on March 11.

We will have speakers from the Attorney General's office come to explain the state of the opioid crisis in New York State, and discuss how our tools can make an impact alongside the legal work, social services, and public policy efforts that are underway to turn the crisis around.
