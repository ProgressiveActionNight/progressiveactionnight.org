Prog Hacknight, in partnership with the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://smartchicagocollaborative.org/), is proud to present our [Women in Tech speaker series](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2017/03/07/presenting-the-women-in-tech-speaker-series.html) celebrating Women's History Month. Throughout the month of March, we will feature amazing women speakers in the civic, nonprofit and technology space.

For our second episode, we welcome [Sandee Kastrul](https://twitter.com/SandeeKastrul), president and co-founder of [i.c.stars](http://www.icstars.org/), an innovative nonprofit leadership and technology training program founded in 1999 to prepare inner-city adults for technology careers and community leadership.

From well-known leaders at major institutions to hyperlocal changemakers at community centers, women in Chicago are working to ensure that more residents have access to technology training and resources.

In her talk, Sandee will highlight their stories - what inspires them to strengthen communities through technology and what journeys brought them to their roles and missions.

**ASL** This event will have an American Sign Language interpreter.

**Food** Food and drinks will be provided. We encourage attendees to bring their own water bottles to reduce waste.
