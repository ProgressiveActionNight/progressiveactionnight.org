It’s about families. It’s about communities. It’s about safety and security.

As we get closer to the last day of the protections provided by the [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals), and after the end of the [Temporary Protected Status (TPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_protected_status) for affected people from Haiti and El Salvador, we are confronted with questions and realities that goes deep into who we are and the kind of community we want to build.

In this HackNight, we will be joined by **Christine Zagrobelny** and **Roy Walter**, volunteer leaders from the [**New Sanctuary Coalition**](//newsanctuarynyc.org), and other leaders from the immigration justice movement to talk about their work supporting immigrants who are going through immigration proceedings, applying for asylum, and asserting their rights in the face of unjust and dehumanizing immigration policies.

With Congress’ persistent inaction on this issue, how can technologists, coders, data folks, UX/UI designers, product managers and media professionals work together to support the work of the immigrant justice movement? What does it mean to protect our friends, families, and neighbors?

On February 13, join us for a thoughtful discussion about immigration — the core issues surrounding it, and how can we create a positive impact. After the discussion, we will have our usual breakout groups, with a learning group for a continued in-depth discussion on immigration.
