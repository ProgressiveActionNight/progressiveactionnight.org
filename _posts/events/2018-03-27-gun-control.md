After years of inaction from Congress on gun control, we are seeing how citizens, led by young people, are standing up, organizing, and taking this issue head on. From the student organizing in Florida, to the National School Walkout and the [March For Our Lives](http://marchforourlives.com/), we are seeing hundreds and thousands of people mobilizing for change. On March 27, join us to discuss how we as technologists can be impactful and use our skills to support the work being done locally and nationally.

A survivor of gun violence, Kim Parker Russell was moved to advocate for commonsense measures to reduce gun violence in America after the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. In 2012, she helped to launch a national grassroots organization – Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America – which quickly became a leading voice of reason in the gun violence prevention movement. Kim has also worked with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as an organizing manager and currently serves as an executive advisor for Women’s March where she played a key role in organizing their NRA2DOJ march and WM Youth Empower Enough! National School Walkouts. Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, Kim is a mother of two living in Brooklyn, New York with a background in graphic design.
