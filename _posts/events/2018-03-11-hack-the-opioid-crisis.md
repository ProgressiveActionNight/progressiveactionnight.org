We have the ideas, we have the plans, now let's hack the opioid crisis.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, in collaboration with [Civic Hall](//www.civichall.org) and [Progressive HackNight](//www.progressivehacknight.org), presents "Hack the Opioid Crisis." A full day of hacking dedicated to implementing and developing the technologies to alleviate the opioid crisis.

According to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 6.4 million Americans suffer from drug abuse. The study shows that a majority of abused prescription drugs were obtained from family and friends, often from the home medicine cabinet.

The National Prescription Drug Take Back Day aims to provide a safe, convenient, and responsible means of disposing of prescription drugs, while also educating the general public about the potential for abuse of medications. On Hack the Opioid Crisis, we will work on projects that will achieve the three key things that will move Take Back Day efforts forward: Lowering The Barrier, Outreach, Inform.

### Lowering the Barrier
Making it easier for people to drop off their unused medicines, by helping them find collection sites and safer approaches to disposing of prescription drugs.

### Outreach
Creating effective campaigns for people to learn more about Take Back Day and building tech to help notify and remind them as Take Back Day approaches.

### Inform
Effectively educating the public about the opioid crisis and how best to help those victimized by it.

We are looking for folks who want to help reduce the number of opioid deaths in the country through technology and media – a part of Attorney General Schneiderman’s multi-pronged approach to tackling the opioid crisis. Coders, Project Managers, Designers, and Creatives welcome!
