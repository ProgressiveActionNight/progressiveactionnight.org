On August 15 at 6:30p at ThoughtWorks ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/jDB4sE59mk92)), Kei Williams is a queer transmasculine identified community organizer with #BlackLivesMatter, NYC Chapter. They will talk about their work and story fighting for black lives and how technologists can support and amplify their efforts.

A self-taught visual artist & graphic designer, they assist small businesses and nonprofit organizations with communications, marketing, and social media. Kei centers their work on those most marginalized in society: transgender persons and those who suffer from mental illness. Kei will talk about their story and where they are now, their work with #BlackLivesMatter, and how technologists can support and amplify the movement for black lives.
